<HR><H3>Running at a command line</H3>

<P>This applet is written in Java.  A pre-compiled version for running at the
command prompt and the source code are available.  To run the pre-compiled
version on your own computer (without needing net access) you first need to
have either the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp"> Java
run time (jre)</a> or <a
href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">development kit</a>
installed on your computer.  <B>If you have a browser, you probably already
have the run time installed.  Look for the program called "java".</B> Then you
need to download the <a href="LineFit.jar">jar file</a> (using "Save link
as..." in your browser).  Once you have this, then in the folder where you
saved the jar file, do

<pre>
    java -jar LineFit.jar Put_the_name_of_your_text_file_with_data_here
</pre>

<H3>Getting and modifying the source code</H3>
To modify the source code and allow it to be recompiled you first need to
download the <a href="LineFit.jar">source</a> by doing "Save link as" in your
browser, and then unpack it using
<pre>
    jar xf LineFit.jar
</pre>

Then you can edit the source code, compile and package it to run as above by
doing
<pre>
    javac -d . -classpath . LineFit*.java
    jar cvfe LineFit.jar LineFit.LineFitMain LineFit/*.class
</pre>
